# Redtangle Controls

## Selecting a Piece
On your turn, left click on the desired piece to move. 

## Moving a Piece
After selecting a piece, left click on the square to move to. 

## Jumping
Jumping is the same as moving a piece to an eight adjacent square; however, after the first jump you can jump again if there are more pieces to jump. If you are attempting a suicide move, then select the piece on the edge of the board and both pieces will be lost. 

## Rotating a Piece
To rotate a piece, use the scroll on your mouse. Scrolling up rotates clockwise, scrolling down rotates counter-clockwise. Once you rotate, your piece is locked and you can only rotate.

## Ending Your Turn 
You must right click to end your turn after you have moved and/or rotated.
